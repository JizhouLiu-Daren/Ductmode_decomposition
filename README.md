# Ductmode_decomposition
This repository contains some codes related with cylindrical duct mode decomposition. The codes are in Matlab and have not been verified unfortunately.

The repository herein contains 3 files: 1)Duct_mode.m  (main file to use to set up duct geometry and input measured/simulated pressure smaple); 2)BessDerivZerosBisect2.m  (from Carey Smith: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28001-bessel-derivative-zeros); 3)jprimemk.mat  (Pre-calculated zeros for the first 50 Bessel modes and first 6 radial modes)


Utility of the files: conduct acoustic mode decomposition in a cylindrical duct; Bessel function order up to 50, radial zero number up to 6;could consider convective mean flow
