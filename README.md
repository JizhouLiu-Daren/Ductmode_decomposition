# Ductmode_decomposition
This repository contains some codes related with cylindrical duct mode decomposition. The codes are in Matlab and have not been verified unfortunately.

The repository herein contains 3 files
---Duct_mode.m  (main file to use to set up duct geometry and input measured/simulated pressure smaple)
---BessDerivZerosBisect2.m  (from Carey Smith: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28001-bessel-derivative-zeros)
---jprimemk.mat  (Pre-calculated zeros for the first 50 Bessel modes and first 6 radial modes)


Utility of the files: conduct acoustic mode decomposition in a cylindrical duct; Bessel function order up to 50, radial zero number up to 6.
