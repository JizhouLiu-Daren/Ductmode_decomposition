In case of a concentric cylindrical duct, the calculation of the in-plane wavenumber is different. But the decomposition step should remain the same.
Here we find 2 files
1. Duct_mode_concentric.m that could do decomposition
2. zerobesscross.m that calculates the zeros of the m-th order cross-product Bessel function found from
